Version 0.2 (22 December 2014):
===============================

The main change to version 0.2 is the addition of the isat function, which is a result of an initiative from Felix Pretis and James Reade. The isat function provides indicator saturation methods (impulses, steps) and is a major new feature of the gets package. To accommodate the new feature numerous minor and major changes have been made throughout. Some of these are:

- plot.arx, plot.gets: new S3 functions

- isatvar: new auxiliary function called by plot.gets when applied to a gets object resulting from isat

- dropvar: new function. The function removes the regressors in a regressor matrix that cause exact multicolinearity. The code is based on the drop.coef function from the ordinal package by Rune Haubo Bojesen Christensen

- diagnostics: new function

- deleted functions: glog.ep, regs.mean, regs.var

- getsm: major speed improvements when the log-variance specification is empty

- getsm/getsv/arx: new arguments, including plot for all three, and print.searchinfo and include.gum for the first two

Bugfixes:

- arx: bugfix of mxreg and vxreg arguments. The bug consisted in erroneous regressor labelling whenever mxreg and/or vxreg were 1-column matrices (or vectors). The bug also affected the getsm and getsv functions

- getsm:
  * bugfix in vcov.type argument which occurred for shortened versions of "ordinary" and "white", e.g. "o" or "w"
  * bugfix in do.pet argument, which occurred when it was set to FALSE


Version 0.1 (14 October 2014):
==============================

All versions until 1.0 should be considered Beta-versions.

The package is based on code from AutoSEARCH (also available on the CRAN), but entails a shift in the underlying development principles. The main motivation behind gets is improved user-friendliness, faster and simpler code, and a package that is easier to extend. The most important differences are:
 
- the sm function has been replaced with the arx function:
  * creator of objects of class 'arx'
  * extraction functions (S3 methods) have been added
  * several arguments have been changed and/or removed
  * numerous minor (and some major) changes throughout the code

- gets.mean and gets.vol have been replaced with the getsm and getsv functions, respectively:
  * both return objects of class 'gets'
  * the main argument is an object of class arx (this improves user-friendliness considerably compared with AutoSEARCH)
  * extraction functions (some of them S3 methods) have been added
  * several arguments have been changed and/or removed
  * numerous minor (and some major) changes throughout the code

- gedlogl and gedestp functions deleted
 
- all model comparisons are now in terms of the normal log-likelihood made up of the residuals and the fitted variance

- gLag has been deleted; instead, glag from the lgarch package is used

- ols.fit1 and ols.fit2 have been deleted and replaced with the function ols

- regs.mean.sm and regs.vol.sm have changed names to regs.mean and regs.var, respectively

- bug fix in eqwma and leqwma (ocurred when p=1)

- numerous minor, and some major, changes have been made throughout the code
