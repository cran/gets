Version 0.1 (14 October 2014):
================================================

All versions until 1.0 should be considered as Beta-versions.

The package is based on code from AutoSEARCH (also available on the CRAN), but entails a shift in the underlying development principles. The main motivation behind gets is improved user-friendliness, faster code and a package that is easier to extend. The most important differences are:
 
- the sm function has been replaced with the arx function:
  * creator of objects of class 'arx'
  * extraction functions (S3 methods) have been added
  * several arguments have been changed and/or removed
  * numerous minor (and some major) changes throughout the code

- gets.mean and gets.vol have been replaced with getsm and getsv functions, respectively:
  * both return objects of class 'gets'
  * the main argument is an object of class arx (this improves the user-
    friendliness considerably)
  * extraction functions (some of them S3 methods) have been added
  * several arguments have been changed and/or removed
  * numerous minor (and some major) changes throughout the code

- gedlogl and gedestp functions have been deleted
 
- all model comparisons are now in terms of the normal log-likelihood made up of the residuals and the fitted variance

- gLag has been deleted; instead, glag from the lgarch package is used

- ols.fit1 and ols.fit2 have been deleted and replaced with the function ols

- regs.mean.sm and regs.vol.sm have changed names to regs.mean and regs.var, respectively

- bug fix in eqwma and leqwma (ocurred when p=1)

- numerous minor, and some major, changes have been made throughout the code
